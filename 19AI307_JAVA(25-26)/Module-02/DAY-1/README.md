# Ex.No:2(A) CLASS AND OBJECT

## QUESTION:
Create a class Course with attributes code, title, credits.

## AIM:
To create a class Course with attributes code, title, and credits to represent course details using object-oriented programming.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Import the necessary package 'java.util'
3.	Define a class Course with attributes code, title, and credits, and create a constructor to initialize them.
4.	Create a method printDetails() to display the course information.
5.	In the main method, read course details using Scanner and create a Course object.
6.	Call printDetails() to display the course details and repeat until input ends.

            String title = scanner.next();
            int credits = scanner.nextInt();

            Course course = new Course(code, title, credits);
